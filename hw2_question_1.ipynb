They require universal solutions and cannot be solved through small groupings of states or coalitions of the willing.The United Nations is the only forum where this can happen.\\xa0 It will also be important to welcome the contributions of civil society, academia, the private sector and other important stakeholders.The stakes are high.\\xa0 A substantive, comprehensive Pact for the Future has the potential to turbocharge implementation of the 2030\\xa0Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals in line with the declaration of the SDG Summit.\\xa0It will help to determine whether we meet the serious challenges of today and tomorrow, or continue down the path of social, financial, political and environmental breakdown.\\xa0 Let me stress that this Pact will fully complement and reinforce our efforts to achieve the SDGs and create a more peaceful, sustainable and equitable world today.\\xa0But, let’s be clear.\\xa0 Time is not on our side.\\xa0 In the two years since my report on Our Common Agenda, new conflicts have emerged and geopolitical tensions are higher than ever.\\xa0 We have crossed a new Rubicon with generative AI.\\xa0We are seeing the signs of climate breakdown.\\xa0 Billions of people around the world have been hit by the cost-of-living crisis.\\xa0 And more countries than ever are struggling with debt distress or default.We cannot inch towards agreement while the world races towards a precipice.\\xa0 We must bring a new urgency to our efforts, and a shared sense of common purpose.\\xa0 Let us draw inspiration from recent global agreements on global biodiversity, on the high seas, on climate loss and damage, and on the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.Reaching agreement will be difficult. \\xa0But, it is possible.\\xa0 I urge you to redouble your efforts over the coming year to ensure that the Pact for the Future is ambitious and transformative.The Summit of the Future must also be a moment to reinforce the connection between global governance and the people of the world.\\xa0 The Pact for the Future must reflect the priorities and concerns of women and men struggling to feed their families, and communities bearing the brunt of the climate emergency.\\xa0 It must offer solutions for a better, fairer, more peaceful and more sustainable world.\\xa0Above all, it must demonstrate that multilateralism can deliver for everyone, everywhere.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\n#UNGA78\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

summary executions — mostly by the Russian Federation — and the forcible transfer of Ukrainian civilians, including children, to territory under Russian control or to the Russian Federation.\\xa0This documentation is vital for accountability.\\xa0 Accountability for all human rights violations is crucial, in line with international norms and standards.The war contributed to an unprecedented surge in global food prices, threatening millions with hunger and poverty.\\xa0 Starting in July 2022, we succeeded in mitigating that impact through the Black Sea Initiative and the Memorandum of Understanding between the United Nations and the Russian Federation.During its one-year period of operation, the Black Sea Initiative, together with the Memorandum of Understanding on facilitating exports of Russian food products and fertilizers, helped to reduce global food prices by over 23\\xa0per\\xa0cent from the record high reached in March last year.\\xa0The Black Sea Initiative enabled the export of nearly 33\\xa0million metric tons of grain and foodstuffs and allowed the World Food Programme to transport 725,000\\xa0metric tons of wheat for humanitarian aid to countries including Afghanistan and Somalia.Under the Memorandum of Understanding, the United Nations delivered solutions on several of the most challenging areas of trade facilitation for Russian food and fertilizers, with continuous work on the remaining issues.We deeply regret that Russia ended its participation in the Black Sea Initiative in July of this year.\\xa0 And that, immediately upon leaving, Russia launched a bombardment of Ukrainian ports and grain storage facilities on the Black Sea and the Danube River.Attacks against terminals and grain stores are unacceptable and such assaults must end.\\xa0 Civilian shipping in the Black Sea has also been threatened.\\xa0 Further escalation could instantly shock the markets and destabilize the region.\\xa0 Volatility and uncertainty have already returned to international grain markets, while supplies from the harvest in Ukraine pile up.The bombardment is also undermining our efforts in the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Russian Federation.\\xa0It has led many of those whose goodwill is needed, notably in the private sector, to question whether there is any real interest in re-joining the Black Sea Initiative.We remain engaged with all parties, aiming to ensure safe and secure exports of grain and fertilizer from Russia and Ukraine. These must be put on a stable footing, without the repeated threat of interruption.\\xa0I am grateful to the Government of Türkiye for its contributions and urge all Member States to support our efforts.The United Nations continues to work towards a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, in line with the Charter, international law, and the resolutions of the General Assembly.\\xa0 I urge all countries to do their part to prevent further escalation, and to lay the foundations for sustainable peace.\\xa0 We are fully committed to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders.This war is already causing limitless suffering. \\xa0Its continuation risks further perilous escalation. \\xa0There is never an alternative to dialogue, diplomacy, and a just peace.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nUkraine\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#UNGA78\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSecurity Council\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Must Turn This Moment of Crisis’ into Opportunity\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks at the General Assembly High-Level Dialogue on Financing for Development, in New York today:Of all the issues we will discuss this week, finance may be the most crucial, because financing for development is the fuel that drives progress on the 2030\\xa0Agenda and the Paris Agreement [for climate change].\\xa0Today, that fuel is running out and the sustainable development engine is stuttering, stalling and backfiring.As we mark the halfway point of the Sustainable Development Goals, progress on our most fundamental priorities — poverty and hunger — has gone into reverse for the first time in decades.\\xa0 The COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis are having a devastating and lasting impact on developing economies.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exacerbated volatility and increased prices for food, energy and finance.\\xa0 A global cost-of-living crisis is affecting billions of people.\\xa0 Governments are drowning in debt. \\xa0Soaring interest rates are squeezing developing countries dry.Official development assistance and climate finance commitments are not being met.\\xa0 There is a stark and growing divide between countries that can access financing at reasonable terms and those that cannot and are being left even further behind.The figures tell their own story. \\xa0Let me provide three.\\xa0 The SDG financing gap has become a chasm, estimated at $3.9\\xa0trillion a year.\\xa0 Developing countries face borrowing costs up to eight times higher than those of European countries in particular, and this is a debt trap.And one in three countries around the world is now at high risk of a fiscal crisis. \\xa0Over 40\\xa0per\\xa0cent of people living in extreme poverty are in countries with severe debt challenges.There have been some good-faith efforts to help developing economies survive this financing crisis, including the G20 [Group of 20] Debt Service Suspension Initiative and the distribution of special drawing rights by the International Monetary Fund\\xa0(IMF).\\xa0 But, they are not enough.It is clear that the systemic problems of financing for sustainable development require a systemic solution: \\xa0reforms of the global financial architecture.\\xa0 That architecture was created at a time when many of today’s developing countries were still under colonial rule. \\xa0It is deeply skewed in favour of the developed world.And it has not kept pace with the growth of the global economy. \\xa0The paid-in capital of the World Bank for example as a percentage of global GDP is one fifth what it was in\\xa01960.I reiterate my call for a new Bretton Woods moment when countries come together to agree on a global financial architecture that reflects today’s economic realities and power relations.\\xa0 I count on your support for these proposed reforms, through the Summit of the Future and beyond.But, while these structural reforms are essential, they will take time — and time is short.\\xa0 The 2030\\xa0Agenda may fall beyond our reach before they bear fruit.\\xa0 I am therefore calling on Governments to take immediate steps to rescue the SDGs.My proposed SDG Stimulus would release at least $500\\xa0billion per year in affordable long-term financing for investments in sustainable development and climate action.\\xa0 Increasing the capital base of multilateral development banks and changing their business model would enable Governments to scale up development and climate investments significantly.Recapitalization and stronger engagement with credit rated agencies would enable the banks to transform their approach to risk, improving their lending terms and leveraging massive amounts of private finance at reasonable cost to developing countries.Governments could create an effective debt workout mechanism to support payment suspensions, include private creditors, and extend to middle-income countries.\\xa0 They can also increase contingency financing when countries run into trouble. \\xa0I am calling for the rechannelling of an additional $100\\xa0billion of special drawing rights, primarily through the multilateral development banks, and for other innovative methods to help countries in need.Developed countries must make good on their finance commitments to developing countries, including on climate.\\xa0 They must meet the $100\\xa0billion promise, significantly increase adaptation finance, replenish the Green Climate Fund and operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund by COP28 [twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\\xa0].\\xa0 And all countries must align national budgets with the SDGs, and address tax abatement and illicit financial flows.Discussions on reform on the financing architecture are taking place from Bridgetown to Paris to Delhi.\\xa0 I welcome the G20’s support for the SDG Stimulus, strengthening Multilateral Development Banks, and increasing finance for development and climate action.The SDG Summit Declaration is a ringing endorsement of strong financing measures to rescue the Sustainable Development Goals.\\xa0 Now we must move from words to urgent action, because the SDGs — a promise to the people of the world — cannot wait.\\xa0 A two-track world of haves and have-nots is already driving a crisis in global trust.I urge you to use this high-level dialogue as a platform for constructive engagement, with a focus on creative and practical financing solutions that can be taken forward in the next months and years.\\xa0 Together, we must turn this moment of crisis into a moment of opportunity, find joint financing solutions to rebuild global solidarity, and create new momentum for sustainable development and climate action.\\xa0And I thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnvironmental issues and sustainable

Calling for Determination to Uphold Charter’s Pledge for Peace\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing is UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ address to the opening of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, in New York today:Just nine days ago, many of the world’s challenges coalesced in an awful hellscape.\\xa0 Thousands of people in Derna, Libya, lost their lives in epic, unprecedented flooding.\\xa0They were victims many times over — victims of years of conflict, victims of climate chaos, victims of leaders, near and far, who failed to find a way to peace.The people of Derna lived and died in the epicentre of that indifference, as the skies unleashed 100 times the monthly rainfall in 24\\xa0hours, as dams broke after years of war and neglect, as everything they knew was wiped off the map.Even now, as we speak, bodies are washing ashore from the same Mediterranean Sea where billionaires sunbathe on their superyachts.\\xa0Derna is a sad snapshot of the state of our world — the flood of inequity, of injustice, of inability to confront the challenges in our midst.Our world is becoming unhinged.\\xa0 Geopolitical tensions are rising.\\xa0 Global challenges are mounting.\\xa0 And we seem incapable of coming together to respond.\\xa0 We confront a host of existential threats — from the climate crisis to disruptive technologies — and we do so at a time of chaotic transition.For much of the cold war, international relations were largely seen through the prism of two superpowers.\\xa0 Then came a short period of unipolarity.\\xa0 Now we are rapidly moving towards a multipolar world.\\xa0 This is, in many ways, positive.\\xa0 It brings new opportunities for justice and balance in international relations.\\xa0 But, multipolarity alone cannot guarantee peace.At the beginning of the twentieth century, Europe had numerous Powers.\\xa0 It was truly multipolar.\\xa0 But, it lacked robust multilateral institutions and the result was the First World War.A multipolar world needs strong and effective multilateral institutions.\\xa0 Yet global governance is stuck in time.\\xa0 Look no further than the United Nations Security Council and the Bretton Woods system.\\xa0They reflect the political and economic realities of\\xa01945, when many countries in this Assembly Hall were still under colonial domination.The world has changed.\\xa0 Our institutions have not.\\xa0 We cannot effectively address problems as they are if institutions do not reflect the world as it is.\\xa0 Instead of solving problems, they risk becoming part of the problem.\\xa0 And indeed, divides are deepening:\\xa0 divides among economic and military Powers, divides between north and south, east and west.We are inching ever closer to a great fracture in economic and financial systems and trade relations, one that threatens a single, open internet, with diverging strategies on technology and artificial intelligence, and potentially clashing security frameworks.It is high time to renew multilateral institutions based on twenty-first century economic and political realities, rooted in equity, solidarity and universality and anchored in the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.That means reforming the Security Council in line with the world of today.\\xa0 It means redesigning the international financial architecture so that it becomes truly universal and serves as a global safety net for developing countries in trouble.I have no illusions.\\xa0 Reforms are a question of power.\\xa0 I know there are many competing interests and agendas.\\xa0 But, the alternative to reform is not the status quo.\\xa0The alternative to reform is further fragmentation.\\xa0 It is reform or rupture.At the same time, divides are also widening within countries.\\xa0Democracy is under threat.\\xa0Authoritarianism is on the march.\\xa0Inequalities are growing.\\xa0 And hate speech is on the rise.\\xa0 In the face of all these challenges and more, compromise has become a dirty word.Our world needs statesmanship, not gamesmanship and gridlock.\\xa0As I told the G20 [Group of 20], it is time for a global compromise.\\xa0 Politics is compromise.\\xa0 Diplomacy is compromise.\\xa0 Effective leadership is compromise.\\xa0 Leaders have a [special] responsibility to achieve compromise in building a common future of peace and prosperity for our common good.Over the past year, we have shown the promise of multilateral action.\\xa0 With important new agreements on safeguarding biodiversity — on protecting the high seas, on climate loss and damage, on the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.We have all the tools and resources to solve our shared challenges.\\xa0 What we need is determination.\\xa0 Determination is in the DNA of our United Nations — summoning us with the first words of the Charter:\\xa0 “We the peoples of the United Nations […] determined”:\\xa0 determined to end the scourge of war; determined to reaffirm faith in human rights; determined to uphold justice and respect international law; and determined to promote social progress and better lives for all people.It falls to us — through our actions — to apply that determination to the challenges of today being faithful to the Charter of the United Nations.\\xa0 It starts with determination to uphold the Charter’s pledge for peace.Yet, instead of ending the scourge of war, we are seeing a surge of conflicts, coups and chaos.\\xa0 If every country fulfilled its obligations under the Charter, the right to peace would be guaranteed.\\xa0 When countries break those pledges, they create a world of insecurity for everyone.Exhibit A:\\xa0 Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\\xa0 The war, in violation of the United Nations Charter and international law, has unleashed a nexus of horror:\\xa0 lives destroyed, human rights abused, families torn apart, children traumatized, hopes and dreams shattered.But, beyond Ukraine, the war has serious implications for us all.\\xa0 Nuclear threats put us all at risk.\\xa0 Ignoring global treaties and conventions makes us all less safe.\\xa0 And the poisoning of global diplomacy obstructs progress across the board.We must not relent in working for peace — a just peace in line with the UN Charter and international law.\\xa0 And even while fighting rages, we must pursue every avenue to ease the suffering of civilians in Ukraine and beyond.\\xa0 The Black Sea Initiative was one such avenue.\\xa0 The world badly needs Ukrainian food and Russian food and fertilizers to stabilize markets and guarantee food security and I will not give up on my efforts to make it happen.Around the globe, old tensions fester while new risks emerge.\\xa0Nuclear disarmament is at a standstill while countries develop new weapons and make new threats.\\xa0 Across the Sahel, a series of coups is further destabilizing the region as terrorism is gaining ground.\\xa0 Sudan is descending into full-scale civil war, millions have fled and the country risks splitting apart.In eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, millions are displaced and gender-based violence is a horrific daily reality.\\xa0 In Haiti, a country that suffered centuries of colonial exploitation is today overwhelmed by gang violence, and still awaits international support.In Afghanistan, a staggering 70\\xa0per\\xa0cent of the population needs humanitarian assistance with the rights of women and girls systematically denied.\\xa0 In Myanmar, brutal violence, worsening poverty and repression are crushing hopes for a return to democracy.In the Middle East, escalating violence and bloodshed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is taking a terrible toll on civilians.\\xa0Unilateral actions are intensifying and undermining the possibility of a two-State solution — the only pathway to lasting peace and security for Palestinians and Israelis.\\xa0 Syria remains in ruins while peace remains remote.\\xa0Meanwhile, natural disasters are worsening the man-made disaster of conflict.In the face of these mounting crises, the global humanitarian system is on the verge of collapse.\\xa0 Needs are rising.\\xa0 And funding is drying up.\\xa0 Our humanitarian operations are being forced to make massive cuts.\\xa0 But, if we don’t feed the hungry, we are feeding conflict.\\xa0I urge all countries to step up and to fund fully the Global Humanitarian Appeal.The peace and security architecture is under unprecedented strain.\\xa0That is why, in the context of the preparations for the Summit of the Future, we put forward ideas for the consideration of Member States for a New Agenda for Peace, based on the Charter and international law.It provides a unifying vision to address existing and new threats for a world in transition, calling on States to recommit to a world free from nuclear weapons, and to end the erosion of the nuclear disarmament and arms control regime; bolstering prevention at the global level by maximizing the capacity and convening power of the UN and our good offices to bridge geopolitical divides.Bolstering prevention at the national level by linking actions for peace with progress on the Sustainable Development Goals; putting women’s leadership and participation at the centre of decision-making and committing to the eradication of all forms of violence against women.Calling for a broad-based reflection on peacekeeping and make it nimbler and more adaptable, with forward-looking transition and exit strategies from the start; and supporting peace enforcement action by regional organizations — notably the African Union — with clear Security Council mandates and predictable funding.Determination for peace also requires new governance frameworks for emerging threats, from artificial intelligence to lethal autonomous weapons [systems] that function without human control.Peace is inextricably linked to sustainable development.\\xa0We see a familiar pattern around the world:\\xa0 the closer a country is to conflict, the farther it is from the Sustainable Development Goals.\\xa0 The Charter calls on us to be determined in promoting social progress.\\xa0 In twenty-first century terms, that means achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.Yet, inequality defines our time:\\xa0 from cities where skyscrapers tower over slums to countries that are forced to choose between serving their people or servicing their debts.\\xa0 Today, Africa spends more on debt interest than on health care.Yesterday’s SDG Summit was about a global rescue plan to scale up support from billions to trillions.\\xa0 The international financial architecture remains dysfunctional, outdated and unjust.\\xa0 The deep reforms that are needed won’t happen overnight.But, we can take determined steps now to help countries weather crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic [which were] dramatically impacted:\\xa0by urgently advancing the SDG Stimulus of $500\\xa0billion per year and relieving the financial burden on developing and emerging economies; by scaling up development and climate finance — increasing the capital base and changing the business model of multilateral development banks; by ensuring effective debt relief mechanisms and channelling emergency financial support towards those in greatest need.We must be determined to tackle the most immediate threat to our future:\\xa0 our overheating planet.\\xa0 Climate change is not just a change in the weather.\\xa0 Climate change is changing life on our planet.\\xa0 It is affecting every aspect of our work.\\xa0 It is killing people and devastating communities.Around the world, we see not only accelerating temperatures, we see an acceleration in sea levels rising, glaciers receding, deadly diseases spreading, the extinction of species and cities under threat.And this is only the beginning.\\xa0 We have just survived the hottest days, the hottest months and the hottest summer on the books.\\xa0 Behind every broken record are broken economies, broken lives and whole nations at the breaking point.\\xa0 Every continent, every region and every country is feeling the heat.But, I’m not sure all leaders are feeling that heat.\\xa0Actions are falling abysmally short.\\xa0There is still time to keep rising temperatures within the 1.5°C limits of the Paris Agreement [on climate change].But, that requires drastic steps now:\\xa0 to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, and to ensure climate justice for those who did least to cause the crisis, but are paying the highest price.We have the receipts.\\xa0 G20 countries are responsible for 80\\xa0per\\xa0cent of greenhouse emissions.\\xa0 They must lead.\\xa0 They must break their addiction to fossil fuels, stop new coal and heed the International Energy Agency’s findings that new oil and gas licensing by them is incompatible with keeping the 1.5°C limit alive.To stand a fighting chance of limiting global temperature rise, we must phase out coal, oil and gas in a fair and equitable way, and massively boost renewables.\\xa0 This is the only path to affordable renewable energy for all and importantly many in Africa still lack electricity.So, the fossil fuel age has failed.\\xa0 If fossil fuel companies want to be part of the solution, they must lead the transition to renewable energy: no more dirty production; no more fake solutions; no more bankrolling climate denial.I have laid out a Climate Solidarity Pact in which all big emitters and are asked to make extra efforts to cut emissions and wealthier countries support emerging economies with finance and technology to do so.\\xa0For example, Africa has 60 per cent of the world’s solar capacity, but just 2 per cent of renewable investments.I have also put forward an Acceleration Agenda to supercharge these efforts.\\xa0 Developed countries must reach net zero as close as possible to 2040, and emerging economies as close as possible to 2050 in line with common but differentiated responsibilities.\\xa0 Immediate steps include:\\xa0 an end to coal by 2030 for OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries and 2040 for the rest of the world; an end to fossil fuel subsidies; and a price on carbon.Developed countries must also finally deliver the $100 billion for developing country climate action, as promised; double adaptation finance by 2025, as promised; and replenish the Green Climate Fund, as promised.\\xa0 All countries must work to operationalize the loss and damage fund this year.\\xa0 And ensure universal Early Warning coverage by 2027.Tomorrow, I will welcome credible first movers and doers to our Climate Ambition Summit.\\xa0 COP28 [twenty-eighth United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] is around the corner.\\xa0 Climate chaos is breaking new records, but we cannot afford the same old broken record of scapegoating and waiting for others to move first.And to all those working, marching and championing real climate action, I want you to know that you are on the right side of history and that I am with you.\\xa0 I won’t give up this fight of our lives.\\xa0We must also be determined to honour the Charter’s commitment to fundamental human rights.\\xa0 Just four women signed our founding document.\\xa0 One look around this room shows not enough has changed.\\xa0 “We, the Peoples” does not mean “We, the men.”Women are still waiting for equal opportunities and equal pay; for equality under the law; for their work to be valued and their opinions to count.\\xa0 Around the globe, women’s rights – including sexual and reproductive rights - are being suppressed and even rolled back, and women’s freedoms curtailed.In some countries, women and girls are punished for wearing too many clothes; in others, for wearing too few.\\xa0 Thanks to generations of women’s rights activists, times are changing.\\xa0 From sports fields to schools and public squares, girls and women are challenging the patriarchy -- and winning.\\xa0 I stand with them.I entered this office with a commitment to ensuring gender parity at the UN.\\xa0 We achieved that at senior levels and are on track to do so across the UN system.\\xa0Because gender equality is not the problem.\\xa0 Gender equality is the solution.\\xa0 It is not a favour to women; it is fundamental to ensuring a better future for all.We must be determined to answer the Call to Action to put human rights at the heart of our work.\\xa0 Seventy-five years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there has been enormous progress in some areas, from ending colonization and segregation to ensuring women’s voting rights.But, we have not achieved basic rights for all when 1.2\\xa0billion people still live in acute poverty, and hunger is at levels not seen since\\xa02005:\\xa0 when discrimination on racial and ethnic grounds is perfectly legal in many countries; when people must risk death to seek a better life; when refugees, migrants and minorities are routinely demonized and hounded; when declaring your gender identity or simply who you love can lead to imprisonment or even execution; when speaking out can lead to perilous consequences.Human rights — political, civil, economic, social and cultural – are the key to solving many of the world’s interlinked problems.\\xa0Laws to protect the vulnerable must be enacted and enforced; the targeting of minorities must stop; and human rights and human dignity must be at the centre of social, economic and migration policies.\\xa0 All Governments must fulfil the commitment they made in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.We must also face up to the looming threats posed to human rights by new technology.\\xa0 Generative artificial intelligence (AI) holds much promise, but it may also lead us across a Rubicon and into more danger than we can control.When I mentioned artificial intelligence in my General Assembly speech in\\xa02017, only two other leaders even uttered the term.\\xa0 Now AI is on everyone’s lips — a subject of both awe and fear.\\xa0 Even some of those who developed generative AI are calling for greater regulation.But, many of the dangers of digital technology are not looming.\\xa0They are here.\\xa0 The digital divide is inflaming inequalities.\\xa0 Hate speech, disinformation and conspiracy theories on social media platforms are spread and amplified by AI, undermining democracy and fuelling violence and conflict in real life.\\xa0 Online surveillance and data harvesting are enabling human rights abuses on a mass scale.\\xa0 And technology companies and Governments are far from finding solutions.We must move fast and mend things.\\xa0 New technologies require new and innovative forms of governance — with input from experts building this technology and from those monitoring its abuses.And we urgently need a Global Digital Compact — between Governments, regional organizations, the private sector and civil society — to mitigate the risks of digital technologies and identify ways to harness their benefits for the good of humanity.Some have called for consideration of a new global entity on AI that could provide a source of information and expertise for Member States.\\xa0There are many different models – inspired by such examples as the International Atomic Energy Agency\\xa0(IAEA), International Civil Aviation Organization\\xa0(ICAO) or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The UN stands ready to host the global and inclusive discussions that are needed, depending on the decisions of Member States.\\xa0 To help advance the search for concrete governance solutions, I will appoint this month a High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, which will provide recommendations by the end of this year.Next year’s Summit of the Future is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for progress to deal with these new threats, in line with the vision of the UN Charter.Member States will decide how to move forward on the New Agenda for Peace, the Global Digital Compact, reforms to the international financial architecture, and many other proposals to address challenges and bring greater justice and equity to global governance.The United Nations was created precisely for moments like this — moments of maximum danger and minimum agreement.\\xa0 We can and must use our tools in flexible and creative ways.\\xa0 Last month, we saw the dividends of determination off the coast of Yemen.\\xa0 Carrying 1\\xa0million barrels of oil, the decaying FSO Safer supertanker was a ticking time bomb — a looming ecological disaster in the Red Sea.But, no one offered to solve the problem.\\xa0 So, the United Nations stepped in and brought the world together.\\xa0 We mobilized resources, assembled the experts, navigated difficult negotiations and built trust.We have more work ahead and more resources are needed.\\xa0But, last month, the oil was successfully transferred from the Safer.\\xa0 This UN-led action saved the Red Sea.\\xa0 When no one else could or would, UN determination got the job done.Despite our long list of global challenges, that same spirit of determination can guide us forward.\\xa0 Let us be determined to heal divisions and forge peace:\\xa0 determined to uphold the dignity and worth of every person; determined to realize the Sustainable Development Goals and leave no one behind; determined to reform multilateralism for the twenty-first century and come together for the common good.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\n#UNGA78\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlenary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Hailing Effort to Improve Developing Nations’ Access to Finance\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development Goals, in New York today:Eight years ago, Member States gathered in this Hall to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\xa0 With the world watching — including 193\\xa0young people in the balcony holding blue lamps of hope — you made a solemn promise.\\xa0 A promise to build a world of health, progress and opportunity for all.\\xa0 A promise to leave no one behind.\\xa0 And a promise to pay for it.This was not a promise made to one another as diplomats from the comfort of this chamber.\\xa0 It was — always — a promise to people.\\xa0 People crushed under the grinding wheels of poverty.\\xa0 People starving in a world of plenty.\\xa0 Children denied a seat in a classroom.\\xa0 Families fleeing conflicts, seeking a better life.\\xa0 Parents watching helplessly as their children die of preventable disease.\\xa0 People losing hope because they can’t find a job — or a safety net when they need it.\\xa0Entire communities literally on devastation’s doorstep because of changing climate.So, the SDGs aren’t just a list of goals.\\xa0 They carry the hopes, dreams, rights and expectations of people everywhere.\\xa0 And they provide the surest path to living up to our obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, now in its seventy-fifth year.Yet today, only 15\\xa0per\\xa0cent of the targets are on track and many are going in reverse.\\xa0 Instead of leaving no one behind, we risk leaving the SDGs behind.\\xa0 So, Excellencies, the SDGs need a global rescue plan.\\xa0 I am deeply encouraged by the detailed and wide-ranging draft political declaration under discussion here today — especially its commitment to improving developing countries’ access to the fuel required for SDG progress: finance.This includes clear support for an SDG Stimulus of at least $500\\xa0billion a year, as well as an effective debt-relief mechanism that supports payment suspensions, longer lending terms, and lower rates.\\xa0 It includes a call to re-capitalize and change the business model of multilateral development banks so they can massively leverage private finance at affordable rates to benefit developing countries.\\xa0 And it includes the endorsement of the need to reform the international financial architecture that I consider outdated, dysfunctional and unfair.\\xa0 This can be a game-changer in accelerating SDG progress.I have been calling for a new Bretton Woods moment, and the development of practical solutions by the Summit of the Future next September.\\xa0 But countries can act right now to get the SDGs on track.Together with businesses and financial institutions, local authorities, the United Nations development system and more, you have helped point the way with high-impact initiatives to support six targeted areas where urgent transitions are needed.First — we must take action on hunger.\\xa0 In our world of plenty, hunger is a shocking stain on humanity, and an epic human rights violation.\\xa0 It is an indictment of every one of us that millions of people are starving in this day and age.\\xa0 Building on July’s Food Systems Summit Stocktake, we are marshalling finance, science, data, innovations, and policy and governance support to help countries transform food systems so all people can access a healthy and nutritious diet.Second — the transition to renewable energy isn’t happening fast enough.\\xa0 We are putting forward new Energy Compacts in which governments, businesses and global organizations join forces to invest in decarbonizing energy systems, and ensuring a just and equitable transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.Third — the benefits and opportunities of digitalization are not being spread widely enough.\\xa0 To close the divide, we have launched an initiative to spur digital transformation across 100\\xa0countries, supporting stronger technology capacities, better governance, and innovative financing.\\xa0 Our proposed Global Digital Compact will also help countries build safe digital systems that provide internet access for all — including for students in hard-to-reach communities.Fourth — too many children and young people are victims of poor-quality education, or no education at all. \\xa0We need to build true “learning societies” anchored in quality education — including lifelong learning from the earliest years to adulthood — closing the digital divide, and supporting teachers every step of the way.\\xa0An emerging group of “frontrunner countries” is leading the way in boosting investment and transforming education systems around the world.Fifth — people need decent work and social protection.\\xa0 Working with governments and the private sector, our Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transitions aims to create 400\\xa0million new decent jobs — especially in the green, care and digital economies — and extend social protection to over 4\\xa0billion people. \\xa0Investments in social protection should be massively increased.And sixth — the war on nature must stop.\\xa0 We must end the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss.\\xa0 We’re building a group of champion countries to explore how to reform economic policies, and put nature and biodiversity at the heart of all decision-making.\\xa0 Cutting across all of these transitions is the need to ensure full gender equality.\\xa0 It’s long past time to end discrimination, ensure a place at every table for women and girls, and the end the scourge of gender-based violence.At the halfway point to the SDG deadline, the eyes of the world are on you once again.\\xa0 Over the course of the weekend, young people and civil society groups came to the United Nations — or marched in communities around the world — demanding urgent action.\\xa0Now is the time to prove you are listening.We can prevail.\\xa0 If we act now.\\xa0 If we act together.\\xa0 If we keep our promise to the billions of people whose hopes, dreams and futures you hold in your hands.\\xa0 Now is the time.\\n\\n\\n\\nDevelopment\\nEconomic issues\\nEnvironmental issues and sustainable

       "  'Content': 'The report on prostitution in the EU, its cross-border implications and impact on gender equality and women’s rights was adopted by MEPs with 234 votes in favour, 175 against and 122 abstentions. It underlines that the asymmetry between national rules on prostitution within the EU, given its cross-border nature, leads to more victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation and makes for fertile operating ground for organised crime. Member states should assess existing legislation to avoid any loopholes that allow criminals to act with impunity, while the Commission should develop common EU guidelines guaranteeing the fundamental rights of people in prostitution.\\nMeasures to cut demand and online advertisement \\nProstitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation exist because there is a demand for them, MEPs note. Reducing demand is therefore key to prevent and reduce human trafficking and must be done in a way that does not harm those in prostitution, they say. They call on the member states to take urgent measures to tackle online advertisement that directly or indirectly encourages prostitution or seeks to attract buyers.\\nMEPs also demand support for and cooperation with the police and other law enforcement agencies, social and medical services and NGOs to address trafficking and sexual exploitation and protect women in prostitution.\\nGive people in prostitution access to essential services and protect their rights \\nThe worsening social and economic situation due to COVID-19, and the current energy and cost-of-living crisis have increased all forms of abuse and violence against women, MEPs say, including sexual exploitation, with many women in vulnerable situations being driven into poverty and social exclusion. MEPs demand efficient policies against poverty. They want to improve social protection, tackle school failure, promote education, and the establishment of inclusive policies that support women’s empowerment and economic independence, along with measures that condemn those who exploit.\\nPeople in prostitution face the constant threat of police and judicial persecution, and are marginalised and stigmatised, the report notes, which often hinders their ability to seek justice. MEPs call for full access to high-quality health and social services as well as to the justice system and pathways out of prostitution.\\nQuote\\nMaria Noichl (S&D Germany) rapporteur, said: “Today Parliament is giving a voice to people, and especially women, who have traditionally been overlooked, marginalised and stigmatised in our societies. We are standing by those who have warned for a long time about the reality of prostitution. This report outlines the reasons why the big majority of people end up in prostitution, and it highlights the way forward: create exit programmes and alternatives, eradicate poverty and social exclusion, dismantle stereotypes and inequalities, and reduce demand by tackling the buyers.”\\n'},\n",

       "  'Content': 'Addressing the plenary, the leader of Belarus’ democratic forces Svietlana Tsikhanouskaya called on MEPs to support Belarus’ European perspective and urged Parliament to take its relationship with democratic Belarus to a new level, She proposed the signing of a memorandum before the 2024 EP elections as the basis of cooperation between the European Parliament and democratic Belarus. “Belarusians want to hear that our country will not be given to Putin as a consolation prize,” she said.\\nMs Tsikhanouskaya said they would need help in their fight to bring democracy to Belarus. Lukashenka does not deserve place in the international community, but a ticket to the international court in Hague, she said. Next year Belarusian democratic forces should start issuing their own passports that would confirm Belarusian citizenship, Ms Tsikhanouskaya announced, which will serve as a travel document for exiled Belarusians. ,.Soon she will ask EU governments to recognise this new travel document.\\nYou can watch her speech again here. (13.09.2023)\\nEP President Metsola said: “The people of Belarus must be able to live in freedom. Free from autocracy. Free from oppression. It is what they want. It is what they chose. It is what they deserve. We will continue to support Belarusian democratic forces and to play an active role in shaping the European Union’s response to the on-going political crisis in Belarus. It is critical that we further expand European Union sanctions against the regime and do not lose sight of what they have done.”\\nPrize for EP President Metsola\\nDuring a bilateral meeting, EP President Roberta Metsola received the \"Cross of good neighbourhood\", awarded to outstanding individuals who have significantly helped the cause of Belarusians, from Ms Tsikhanouskaya\\nMEPs alarmed over the situation in Belarus\\nOn Wednesday, Parliament also adopted a new report on EU relations with Belarus, supporting the country’s democratic political parties in their declarations about the European aspirations of Belarusians. MEPs call on the Belarusian regime to release all political prisoners and strongly condemn the Minsk regime’s role as an accomplice in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. They note with great concern the rampant political, economic, military and cultural subordination of Belarus to Moscow, rendering the country a de-facto satellite state hosting tactical nuclear weapons under Russian command.\\nIn the report, MEPs also call for tougher EU sanctions against Belarus while stressing that the recent arrival of Russian mercenary Wagner Group fighters creates new potential security risks for Ukraine as well as for Belarus’ EU neighbours and the wider EU. The text will be available in full here (13.09.2023). EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell and MEPs also discussed the new report on Tuesday afternoon (12.09.2023).\\nThe report adopted by 453 votes in favour, 21against and 40 abstentions.'},\n",

Joint purchases will have to involve at least three member states, and should be open to the participation of members of the European Free trade Association which are members of the European Economic Area (associated countries).Contractors and subcontractors must be established in the EU or in an associated country, and not be subject to control by a non-associated third country or entity. The cost of components originating in the EU or associated countries shall not be lower than 65% of the estimated value of the end product.Bonuses for projects supporting Ukraine, Moldova and SMEsThe EU financial contribution to each action will be capped at 15% of the estimated value of the common procurement contract per consortium. This ceiling may be raised to 20% if Ukraine or Moldova are recipients of additional quantities of defence products, or if at least 15% of the estimated value of the common procurement contract is allocated to SMEs or mid-capitalisation companies (those with a medium market capitalisation, known as midcaps), as contractors or subcontractors.Quotes“Today's vote marks a historic moment for EU defence, establishing the first EU instrument for joint procurement by member states. It will help them to refill their stocks, increase interoperability among our armed forces, strengthen our industry and contribute to our unwavering support for Ukraine. However, facing a historical crisis, EDIRPA can only be a starting point for a far more ambitious common defence agenda,” co-rapporteur for Foreign Affairs committee Michael Gahler (EPP, DE) said after the vote.“We have reached a reasonable compromise that will make EDIRPA complementary to another regulation important for the defence sector: the Act in Support of Ammunition Production. We managed to defend the Parliament's priorities, including for projects that will support Ukraine or Moldova. Most importantly, by intensifying the joint procurement of military equipment, EDIRPA will help to strengthen member states’ defence capabilities,” co-rapporteur for Industry, Research and Energy committee Zdzislaw Krasnodębski (ECR, Poland) said.Next steps\\nThe legislation was adopted with 530 votes to 66, with 32 abstentions. It now requires the Council's formal approval in order to become law.BackgroundRussia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has dramatically underlined the need to adapt the European defence industrial and technological base (EDTIB) to structural changes: ramp up EU military R&D, modernise military equipment, and strengthen cooperation between Member States in the framework of procurement in the field of defence, in order to make the Union a relevant global player.\"},\n",

It became clear that Europe not only needs the tools to develop long-term policies, with clear goals and roadmaps. It must also be ready to act quickly, efficiently and in the interests of every European. The EU must also thoroughly evaluate its role in the global response to the pandemic and commit more than ever to international cooperation and solidarity, especially with partners in the Global South.

A robust monitoring and enforcement mechanism will accompany this objective to make sure member states deliver on their national contributions to this binding EU target.\\n\\nBy 2030, member states need to save on average 1.5% per year. The annual energy savings will begin with 1.3% in the period until the end of 2025, and will progressively reach 1.9% in the last period up to the end of 2030.\\n\\nThe saving targets should be met through local, regional and national measures, in different sectors - e.g. public administration, buildings, businesses, data centres, etc. MEPs insisted that the scheme should in particular cover the public sector, which will have to reduce its final energy consumption by 1.9% each year. Member states should also ensure that at least 3% of public buildings are renovated each year into nearly-zero energy buildings or zero-emission buildings.

During the talks with the representatives of the Council, MEPs secured €3.3 billion for research and innovation related to chips. A network of competence centres will be created to address the EU’s skills shortage and attract new talent for research, design and production.\\n\\nCrisis response mechanism to address supply problems\\nA crisis response mechanism will be set up, through which the Commission will assess the risks to the EU’s supply of semiconductors. Early warning indicators in member states will be used to trigger an EU-wide shortage alert.\\n\\nThis mechanism will allow the Commission to implement emergency measures such as prioritising the supply of products particularly affected by a shortage, or carrying out common purchasing for member states.

The legislative proposal aims to bring it up to 20%. Another piece of Parliament analysis from 2022 highlighted that the pandemic has revealed long-standing vulnerabilities in global supply chains, and the unprecedented shortage of semiconductors is a prime example. It shows what might be in store in the years to come.

It also responds to the need for supply security and manufacturing enhancement in Europe, as outlined in proposal 12(12). The Act echoes the sentiments of proposal 17(3) and 17(7), advocating for strengthened EU supply chains through strategic investments and enhanced inter-member state cooperation to manage supply chain risks.
